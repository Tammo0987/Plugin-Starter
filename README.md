# Plugin Starter

This project should create minecraft plugin boilerplate code via CLI or maybe later, from a webinterface.

It is currently a project, where I am working on in my streams.

## Features

Planned features are:

+ Different plugin API support (Spigot, Sponge...)
+ Templates
+ Common dependencies
+ Build Tool support
+ Website for generating
+ Command line interface
